# Projects
This repository contains a variety of projects that I, along with my peers, completed throughout my Masters of Science in Data Science at SMU. 

Previously an Electrical Engineer, my interest in data and developing my software accumen led me to data science. Throughout my classes at SMU I was able to learn the statistics and mathematics behind models, and also how to clean data and create models in R, Python, and SAS. I continue to build my skills in R and Python through various textbooks and online resources, focusing on machine learning methods.
